## Notes

root directory: 
	README
	makefile
	
	
	doc directory
		- stories
		- IEEE 
		- make copies not web links
		- documentation on solving quadratics
		- accuracy and precision - difference, relative error and absolute error 
		
	spikes
		- IEEE
		- quad
		- acc/precision
			- quadratic equation tests
				- ok, INF, NaN, no accuracy, no precision, condition
				
	source directory
		- main, io, desc
			
	build directory
		
		
		
stories:
	- solve quadratic with a command line interface program
	- linux + gcc
	- input can be valid floats
	- output: 2 roots, double root, complex root
		- only print out 2 roots or double roots
	- want full precision and accuracy...?
		- if not, return an indication of issues
		- give some hint that answer is not accurate or precise
	
	
	thought: extend to OSX or Windows on later release?
			 take input from file or script?
