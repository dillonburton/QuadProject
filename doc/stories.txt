- solve quadratic with a command line interface program, 2 hours, risk: 1, 90% complete
	- linux + gcc
	
- input can be valid floats, 30 min, risk 2 (floating point accuracy issues), 10% complete
	- want full precision and accuracy...?
		- if not, return an indication of issues
		- give some hint that answer is not accurate or precise

- output: 2 roots, double root, complex root, 20 min, risk 1, 100%
	- only print out 2 roots or double roots, no complex roots
	
- unit testing, seatest, 3 hours, risk 3, 30% complete

thought: extend to OSX or Windows on later release?
		 take input from file or script?
