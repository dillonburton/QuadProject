- solve quadratic with a command line interface program
- linux + gcc
- input can be valid floats
- output: 2 roots, double root, complex root
	- only print out 2 roots or double roots
- want full precision and accuracy...?
	- if not, return an indication of issues
	- give some hint that answer is not accurate or precise


thought: extend to OSX or Windows on later release?
		 take input from file or script?
